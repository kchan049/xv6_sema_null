# xv6_sema_null
xv6 implementation of semaphores/null pointer deref

1. First, we type `git clone https://github.com/kchan049/xv6_sema_null.git` to clone my repository.

2. Now, we change directory into the folder where all of the kernel code is in with `cd kchan049zzhou007lab2/xv6_lab2`.

3. To compile and run code type `make qemu-nox`. This runs the qemu simulator with no x11 forwarding. 

4. We can run many semaphore test cases. Before you try out test files, you must have `make qemu-nox` typed in. 

5. Now, we can type `monkey` to test dominant monkey semaphore problem. You can also type `h2o` or `river` to test the other semaphore problems.

6. Similarly, you can also type `crash` to test null pointer derefence.  

If you have any questions, you can contact me at `kchan049@ucr.edu`.

You can also checkout the pdf report for more detailed analysis on this project!

Thanks!
